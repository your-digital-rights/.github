# We are Conscious Digital

## A non-profit creating people-centered digital initiatives promoting and advancing digital human rights

We believe in a world where individuals, not corporations or governments, are first-class citizens of the digital domain. Where technology makes us better versions of ourselves rather than facilitating consumption. A world where we are free to express our full selves, free from manipulative influences. Where digital experiences are helpful, not addictive. We aim to do this by empowering individuals to exercise their digital rights, including the right to privacy, anonymity, and free speech.

## Main Projects
[Your Digital Rights](https://yourdigitalrights.org/)
YourDigitalRights.org is a free and open-source service that helps people regain control of their online privacy by automating the process of sending data deletion requests to organizations and then providing guidance on how to ensure that requests are resolved favorably. More than 400,000 requests have been submitted via the service to date. 

[Data Brokers Watch](https://databrokerswatch.org/)
Tracking and mapping the data broker ecosystem: We curate the largest publicly available database of data brokers and make it available to the wider research community. The full dataset currently includes up to 60+ data points on 1075 services distributed across the globe.

## Change

Our modern society is increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, made possible by the degree to which we have integrated the digital domain into our institutions, culture, and everyday lives.

This reality leaves us exposed to a variety of influence campaigns. These include targeted advertising (surveillance capitalism), political and social manipulation via micro-targeting and misinformation, various types of fraud, and the addictive nature of many digital experiences. Children and young adults are particularly susceptible to these influences.

People feel increasingly powerless to fight against these trends. The result is an ever-increasing influence – political, economic, social, or otherwise – over every aspect of our lives. At the heart of all these negative trends is the collection of, trade-in, and misuse of personal information.

Conscious Digital was created to empower individuals to reclaim their privacy, anonymity, and free speech. It’s a long road, but each data request sent via our services makes a difference. To the individual, it means one less company exploiting their data. To the company, it is a clear message that people care about their privacy, and the small cost they pay to process the request is an incentive.
